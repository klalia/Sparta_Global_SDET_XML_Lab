# XML_Lab

XML testing practice using the nokogori gem. This lab enabled us to practice testing an XML file, the nokogori gem allowed us to easily access to the XML path to get to a specific destination through different parent and children nodes.

### XML

XML is eXtensive Markup Language. XML is to transfer and store data consisting of children and parent nodes that holds the data in text format. XML is just information wrapped in tags and it was designed to carry data, focusing on what data is with not predefined tag names.
